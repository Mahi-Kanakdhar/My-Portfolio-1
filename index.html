            <h2>I am a Reader</h2>
            <p>My hobby is reading interesting and knowledgeable books in my free time. Whenever I go to home from my school I like to read such books after completing my home work. I'm 11 1/2 years old and study in class 6th, means now the class is going to start. Now I know very well that reading is very good habit which can make me a complete. This hobby can be developed by anyone however I got this naturally. Reading books keep one always happy and busy too! It is the good source of enjoyment, knowledge, inspiration. It makes us diciplined, loyal, punctual and most importantly a successful person in the life.</p>
